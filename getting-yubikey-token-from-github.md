# How to get a Yubikey token from GitHub

Here is how to get an Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) Yubikey
token from GitHub.
Note that tokens are also called "security keys" or "keys".

It's easy.
First, go to the [OpenSSF & GitHub MFA Enablement Form](https://forms.gle/zYLbdmGsgAFbeZr26) to enter your validation code into.
your eligibility to this program via a verification code.

A few days later you will receive a coupon code via email
that will allow you to get
a [GitHub branded Yubikey from their shop](https://thegithubshop.com/products/github-branded-yubikey?_pos=1&_sid=4893867a7&_ss=r)
for free.

One caveat: These tokens are
shipped from the US, so they cannot be shipped to countries if it
is illegal to do so under US law.
Our apologies; we canâ€™t control US law.

You will need to enter your email address, your github user name/handle, and the validation code you were provided.

After you accepted to participate in this project, you will receive a coupon code to order your key.


### Use coupon code to "buy" token

You then go to the [GitHub branded Yubikey from their shop](https://thegithubshop.com/products/github-branded-yubikey?_pos=1&_sid=4893867a7&_ss=r) to "buy" the token with the coupon code.

Enter the appropriate information (email address, name, address, etc.).  
Use the coupon code mailed to you and "Apply" it to your order.  This should adjust the price to "$0 USD".

**Important**: Use a shipping address where you have reasonable confidence
that the token will not be tampered with at its destination nor
will tampered with along the way. For most
people, a home or business address is fine.
However, if you're concerned about interception,
consider using a special address (e.g., of someone else you trust).

Press "Continue to Shipping" to confirm the information is correct and complete your order!
