# How to get a Yubikey token from GitHub

Here is how to get an Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) Yubikey
token from GitHub.
Note that tokens are also called "security keys" or "keys".

It's easy.
First, GitHub will send you a form to collect your GitHub handle and verify
your eligibility to this program via a verification code.
A few days later you will receive a coupon code that will allow you to get
a [GitHub branded Yubikey from their shop](https://thegithubshop.com/products/github-branded-yubikey?_pos=1&_sid=4893867a7&_ss=r)
for free.

One caveat: These tokens are
shipped from the US, so they cannot be shipped to countries if it
is illegal to do so under US law.
Our apologies; we canâ€™t control US law.

## Get started

After you accepted to participate in this project, you will receive a validation code and a form to fill in.

## Use validation code to get coupon code

First, you'll go to a form that lets you convert a validation code
into a coupon code.

The form will include information about this program and
legal text to get consent for using the data collected.

You'll need to provide your email address and GitHub handle.
Note that this information goes to GitHub, not back to OpenSSF.
Of course, you'll also have to provide the validation code.

Presuming you enter a valid unused validation code, you'll then
get a (single-use) coupon code.

## Use coupon code to "buy" token

You then go to the GitHub Shop to "buy" the token with the coupon code.

**Important**: Use a shipping address where you have reasonable confidence
that the token will not be tampered with at its destination nor
will tampered with along the way. For most
people, a home or business address is fine.
However, if you're concerned about interception,
consider using a special address (e.g., of someone else you trust).
