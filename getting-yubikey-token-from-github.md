# How to get a Yubikey token from GitHub

Here is how to get an Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) Yubikey
token from GitHub.
Note that tokens are also called "security keys" or "keys".

It's easy.
First, you'll go to a GitHub form at ???github.com
to convert your validation code into a coupon code.
Then you go to the
[GitHub Shop's Yubikey page](<https://thegithubshop.com/products/github-branded-yubikey?_pos=1&_sid=4893867a7&_ss=r)
and buy what you need;
if you have a coupon code you can use it to get the token for free.

One caveat: These tokens are
shipped from the US, so they cannot be shipped to countries if it
is illegal to do so under US law.
Our apologies; we canâ€™t control US law.
