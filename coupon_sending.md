# Coupons for a critical project

## Background

The following draft text is to be sent by a "sender" to a
critical project's PRIVATE email address (or similar private channel),
once they've agreed to accept the coupon codes.

NOTE: This needs to be fixed, GitHub plans to distribute a form entry
that would then give a coupon code.

Improvements welcome!

## Sending coupon code text

Thanks so much for being willing to use these free
*free* multi-factor authentication (MFA) hardware tokens!

Below are the coupon codes for the Google Titan and GitHub Yubikey tokens.
Please distribute each one to maintainers and contributors to your
project and/or open source software projects that your project depends on.
DO NOT make the coupon codes public, each one can only be used *once*.

Those getting the Titan tokens from Google would use the Google Store's page for Titan tokens at <https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key>.
We have step-by-step instructions for getting a Titan key at <https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/getting-titan-token-from-google.md>.

Those getting the Yubikey tokens from GitHub would use the GitHub Shop's Yubikey page at <https://thegithubshop.com/products/github-branded-yubikey?_pos=1&_sid=4893867a7&_ss=r>.

As we noted earlier, to qualify, each token recipient must:

1. Be a maintainer or contributor to this critical open source software (OSS)
   project, or to another OSS project that this project depends on
   (the dependency may be indirect).
2. Try to use an MFA token once they receive the token.
   We'd like recipients to use MFA tokens from then on, but at least try.
3. Not reuse the token between different people (the token must not be shared).
4. Consider providing feedback to us (so we can try to fix problems).

We also need each project that receives coupon codes (you)
to tell us, within 30 days of getting the codes:

1. How many people used the coupon codes to receive an MFA token, and
2. How many of those people didn't have an MFA hardware
   token before.

The people you sent thee coupon codes should be able to tell you this!
We need this information so we can tell others some simple measures of success.
We don't need the names of any individuals.

Please note that the tokens are shipped from the US, so while they
can be shipped internationally, we can't ship somewhere if that is
forbidden (sanctioned) under US law as listed on
<https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information>.
So unless rules change we can't ship them to China, Afghanistan, Russia,
Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria.  Sorry about that.

We provide how-tos and other information at the
"Great Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Distribution Project" site:
