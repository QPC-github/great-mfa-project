# Invitation for a critical project

## Background

The following draft text is an invitation to a critical project
to request MFA tokens. In most cases these would be created
as an issue on the project's GitHub/GitLab/etc. page, or sent as
an email to their security contact email address.

NOTE: This needs to be fixed, GitHub plans to distribute a form entry
that would then give a coupon code.

Improvements welcome!

## Invitation text

Hello! I am <YOUR NAME> and I work with the OpenSSF's 
   [Developer Best Practices Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers).
Our group is dedicated to improving open source developers' working 
   lives through highlighting good security practices that can simply 
   be added into a developer's of project's workflow to increase the 
   overall security posture of that community.
   
Our group has undertaken a project we've dubbed "[The Great MFA Distribution Project](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project)"
   in the hopes of improving open source developers authentication 
   security (logging into tooling and infrastrure) and 
   the integrity of the code that project delivers (code-signing).  
   We'd like to give your project's maintainers *free*
multi-factor authentication (MFA) hardware tokens from Google and GitHub.
We'd especially like to give them to any of your maintainers
who aren't already using any.

If your project is interested, please let us know how many you'd like 
   by 2021-12-20 (and preferably sooner).
We can provide your project up to 5 Titan tokens from Google and up to
5 Yubikey tokens from GitHub.  If you could use more, please let us know that,
we work to try an accomodate that request to get your group more.  Please *also* tell us an email
address where we can *privately* send you the coupon codes and
validation codes needed to get the tokens.  These codes are use-once, so
make sure you can keep them private until they're used by the
intended person.

The token recipients would use the coupon codes and validation codes to "buy"
the tokens from the Google Store and/or GitHub Shop, who would ship
the tokens directly to recipients.  
   
Note: The Google coupon codes *must* be used by 2021-12-31 or they expire.

These tokens are being provided free-of-charge by Google and GitHub
through the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)'s
"Great Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Distribution" project.
Our goal is to counter supply chain attacks on open source software (OSS)
where an attacker steals a maintainer's password and uses it to distribute
malware. These attacks have already occurred many times, such as in
[UA-Parser-JS]([https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/popular-npm-package-ua-parser-js-poisoned-with-cryptomining-password-stealing-malware), [coa, and rc](https://therecord.media/malware-found-in-coa-and-rc-two-npm-packages-with-23m-weekly-downloads/).
Your project has been identified as critical open source software (OSS) project
and we'd like to give you tokens to help you.

To qualify, each token recipient must:

1. Be a maintainer or contributor to this critical open source software (OSS)
   project, or to another OSS project that this project depends on
   (the dependency may be indirect).
2. Try to use an MFA token once they receive the token.
   We'd like recipients to use MFA tokens from then on, but at least try.
3. Not reuse the token between different people (the token must not be shared).
4. Consider providing feedback to us (so we can try to fix problems).

We also need each project that receives coupon codes and/or validation codes
to tell us these numbers (preferably within 30 days of getting the codes):

1. How many tokens did you distribute from just Google? From just GitHub?
2. How many people received tokens from just Google? From just GitHub? From both?
3. How many people didnâ€™t have hardware tokens they used for OSS who received tokens from just Google? From just GitHub? From both?


We ask for this information so we can tell others some simple measures of success.
We don't need nor want the names of any individuals participating.

Please note that the tokens are shipped from the US, so while they
can be shipped internationally, we can't ship somewhere if that is
[forbidden (sanctioned) under US law](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information).
So at this time we are unable to ship to individuals in China, Afghanistan, Russia,
Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria.  Sorry about that.
