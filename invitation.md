# Invitation for a critical project

## Background

The following draft text is an invitation to a critical project
to request MFA tokens. In most cases these would be created
as an issue on the project's GitHub/GitLab/etc. page, or sent as
an email to their security contact email address.

Improvements welcome!

## Invitation text

Hi! We'd like to give your project's maintainers
*free* multi-factor authentication (MFA) hardware tokens.
We'd especially like to give them to any of your maintainers
who aren't already using any.

Please let us know how many you'd like by 2021-12-20 (and preferably sooner).
We can provide your project up to ??5 Titan tokens from Google and
??5 Yubikey tokens from GitHub.  If you'd use more, let us know that,
we might be able to give you more.  Please *also* tell us an email
address where we can *privately* send you the coupon codes to get the tokens.
The coupon codes are use-once, so make sure you can keep them private.
The Google coupon codes *must* be used by 2021-12-31 or they expire.

These tokens are being provided free-of-charge by Google and GitHub
through the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)'s
"Great Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Distribution" project.
We would give your project some coupon codes, which you would give to
your maintainers to use on the Google and GitHub stores (respectively).

Our goal is to counter supply chain attacks on open source software (OSS)
where an attacker steals a maintainer's password and uses it to distribute
malware. These attacks have already occurred many times, such as in
[UA-Parser-JS]([https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/popular-npm-package-ua-parser-js-poisoned-with-cryptomining-password-stealing-malware), [coa, and rc](https://therecord.media/malware-found-in-coa-and-rc-two-npm-packages-with-23m-weekly-downloads/).
Your project has been identified as critical open source software (OSS) project
and we'd like to give you tokens to help you.

To qualify, each token recipient must:

1. Be a maintainer or contributor to this critical open source software (OSS)
   project, or to another OSS project that this project depends on
   (the dependency may be indirect).
2. Try to use an MFA token once they receive the token.
   We'd like recipients to use MFA tokens from then on, but at least try.
3. Not reuse the token between different people (the token must not be shared).
4. Consider providing feedback to us (so we can try to fix problems).

We also need each project that receives coupon codes
to tell us, within 30 days of getting the codes:

1. How many people used the coupon codes to receive an MFA token, and
2. How many of those people didn't have an MFA hardware
   token before.

The people you sent thee coupon codes should be able to tell you this!
We need this information so we can tell others some simple measures of success.
We don't need the names of any individuals.

Please note that the tokens are shipped from the US, so while they
can be shipped internationally, we can't ship somewhere if that is
[forbidden (sanctioned) under US law](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information).
So unless rules change we can't ship them to China, Afghanistan, Russia,
Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria.  Sorry about that.

We provide how-tos and other information at the
"Great Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Distribution Project" site:
